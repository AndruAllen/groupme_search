Hello Chris Rech, your search for [database] returned 7 results.
[04/19 20:07:01] Andrew Allen: Yes we do and no the database isn’t strictly necessary but I’m not totally sure how elastic search would handle 100s of index’s 
[04/19 18:32:33] Chris Rech: So the database isn't strictly necessary right
[03/15 02:57:28] Chris Rech: I'm ok with having it all stored locally unless we have time to do a database. We don't really need to make this efficient really
[03/14 23:38:54] Andrew Allen: Worry about a database later if we want to scale
[03/14 23:37:14] Andrew Allen: So ideally we have a database structure that stores everything and then we keep the most recently used/ most vital indexes alive (at scale that is) and then just index data as it needs to be searched (it’s really quick to index small amounts of text so the user wouldn’t even notice in most cases)
[03/14 23:34:43] Andrew Allen: Well elasticsearch indexes data that you load into it, so it’s more of a temporary store. You can treat each index as a database table or collection, but I think it’s less stable and takes up more memory.
[03/14 20:00:43] Andrew Allen: I think for a database it doesn’t really matter what we use, but I’d prefer one that stores the memory on disk such that if we had to bring the server down or move it we could just transfer the files and not have to re-pull all the data

[04/19 15:15:56] Andrew Allen: The password is: "LongLiveTyrion!123"
[03/15 03:28:27] Andrew Allen: Yeah that’s what I was thinking
[03/14 23:38:40] Andrew Allen: But for prototyping and building it right now we can just focus on building the right indexes (like what filters and info retrieval strategies we should apply) and then just keep everything in elasticsearch
[03/14 23:37:14] Andrew Allen: So ideally we have a database structure that stores everything and then we keep the most recently used/ most vital indexes alive (at scale that is) and then just index data as it needs to be searched (it’s really quick to index small amounts of text so the user wouldn’t even notice in most cases)

[03/14 22:14:05] Andrew Allen: A possible schema for our data, we would index all most recently used chats in elasticsearch is what I was thinking. It's in a draw.io file on the drive if you want to edit/add/remove stuff.
[03/14 22:12:04] Andrew Allen: Here is a better image
[03/14 20:00:43] Andrew Allen: I think for a database it doesn’t really matter what we use, but I’d prefer one that stores the memory on disk such that if we had to bring the server down or move it we could just transfer the files and not have to re-pull all the data

[03/20 01:00:55] Chris Rech: May have issues with Docker due to having Windows Home instead of Pro. Should be able to run it without docker fine, right?
[03/14 23:34:43] Andrew Allen: Well elasticsearch indexes data that you load into it, so it’s more of a temporary store. You can treat each index as a database table or collection, but I think it’s less stable and takes up more memory.
[03/14 20:00:43] Andrew Allen: I think for a database it doesn’t really matter what we use, but I’d prefer one that stores the memory on disk such that if we had to bring the server down or move it we could just transfer the files and not have to re-pull all the data
[03/14 19:59:17] Andrew Allen: But I’ve gotten pretty comfortable with elasticsearch and I think we can just use it as a data store for right now as well

[04/19 20:07:30] Andrew Allen: It’s all running in the same network of docker containers right now
[04/19 18:55:08] Chris Rech: Do we have elasticsearch downloaded on the VM
[04/19 18:33:30] Chris Rech: And we have the elasticsearch instance constantly running
[04/19 18:32:33] Chris Rech: So the database isn't strictly necessary right
[04/19 16:26:28] Chris Rech: So there shouldn't be any issues with the query handling interface I just need to do the rest of the code for it
[04/19 16:07:52] Andrew Allen: I didn’t create a Db for any data yet. Pymongo will work fine as an interface there
[04/19 15:43:48] Chris Rech: Can see the admin and local dbs 
[04/19 15:19:49] Andrew Allen: I also ported kibana to the public ip for the time being. You can view it to mess around with elasticsearch at: http://137.135.109.251:5601/
[04/19 15:16:59] Andrew Allen: I also installed the mongo shell which you can google about but it's just a cli to test stuff

Hello Andrew Allen, your search for [double] returned 3 results.
[04/20 18:27:17] Andrew Allen: See it double sent for quickly then it didn't
[04/20 18:25:33] Andrew Allen: Yeah, the only way it repondeds twice is if it sees that the search was sent twice which the groupme api might sometimes as sometimes it double sends the same message that I send once. Before monday we should probably add it to
[04/20 18:23:13] Chris Rech: and it double responds? is that because two instances are running

[04/19 15:15:56] Andrew Allen: The password is: "LongLiveTyrion!123"
[04/19 15:15:04] Andrew Allen: So I've got a VM with mongo + es live
[03/14 23:37:14] Andrew Allen: So ideally we have a database structure that stores everything and then we keep the most recently used/ most vital indexes alive (at scale that is) and then just index data as it needs to be searched (it’s really quick to index small amounts of text so the user wouldn’t even notice in most cases)
[03/14 22:14:05] Andrew Allen: A possible schema for our data, we would index all most recently used chats in elasticsearch is what I was thinking. It's in a draw.io file on the drive if you want to edit/add/remove stuff.
[03/14 22:12:04] Andrew Allen: Here is a better image
[03/14 18:25:27] Chris Rech: https://aggiesalarytrends.azurewebsites.net/ is what i've spent this whole week working on actually

Hello Chris Rech, your search for [database] returned 7 results.
[04/19 20:07:01] Andrew Allen: Yes we do and no the database isn’t strictly necessary but I’m not totally sure how elastic search would handle 100s of index’s 
[04/19 18:32:33] Chris Rech: So the database isn't strictly necessary right
[03/15 02:57:28] Chris Rech: I'm ok with having it all stored locally unless we have time to do a database. We don't really need to make this efficient really
[03/14 23:38:54] Andrew Allen: Worry about a database later if we want to scale
[03/14 23:37:14] Andrew Allen: So ideally we have a database structure that stores everything and then we keep the most recently used/ most vital indexes alive (at scale that is) and then just index data as it needs to be searched (it’s really quick to index small amounts of text so the user wouldn’t even notice in most cases)
[03/14 23:34:43] Andrew Allen: Well elasticsearch indexes data that you load into it, so it’s more of a temporary store. You can treat each index as a database table or collection, but I think it’s less stable and takes up more memory.
[03/14 20:00:43] Andrew Allen: I think for a database it doesn’t really matter what we use, but I’d prefer one that stores the memory on disk such that if we had to bring the server down or move it we could just transfer the files and not have to re-pull all the data

Hello Chris Rech, your search for [problem] returned 4 results.
[04/13 03:59:46] Chris Rech: It was just a gross problem 
[04/13 03:59:39] Chris Rech: Yeah I was getting runtime errors and WAs for an hour straight on the string problem then just redid my solution to be slower and it ended up being fast enough anyways lol
[04/13 03:51:09] Julia Graham: Yeah the trie thing is what I was going for but my implementation had some unknown problem. Unlucky
[04/13 03:35:10] Michael Earl: No, not that, I'm just confused about not getting the hard case for the last problem

Hello Chris Rech, your search for [greedy] returned 5 results.
[04/16 00:08:57] Michael Earl: So, at one point I tried a greedy thing for A. Turns out, I wasn't one line away from being correct, I was one character away, lol. Just needed to reverse the sorting order
[04/13 19:04:26] Michael Earl: My greedy for C was only wrong in that I forgot that you might need to take a non-maximal length substring between two strings
[04/13 03:45:36] Michael Earl: There was a greedy for C. Just the wrong greedy
[04/13 03:35:48] Julia Graham: Yamen did greedy too and didn’t get the hard case
[04/13 03:35:30] Michael Earl: Nah, I did a greedy thing
